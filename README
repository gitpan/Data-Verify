Data::Verify
============

Using object oriented techniques, you can create a hierarchy
of tests for verifying any data.

Here an example in pseudo-code:

	DATA_TYPE A (extends DATA_TYPE B)
	{
		PASS
		{
			TEST 5
			TEST 6
		}

		FAIL
		{
			TEST 1
			TEST 2
			TEST 3
			TEST 4
		}
	}

In real code:

	verify( value => '00-00-00', 'gregorian_date' );
