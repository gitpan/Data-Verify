NAME

Data::Verify - versatile data/type verification, validation and testing

VERSION

0.01.24 (Fri Jan  3 00:48:50 2003)

DESCRIPTION

This module supports types. Out of the ordinary it supports parameterised types (like
databases have i.e. VARCHAR(80) ). When you try to feed a typed variable against some
odd data, this module explains what he would have expected. It doesnt support casting (yet).

Functionality was utilised amongst others by Regexp::Common, Email::Valid and Business::CreditCard.
